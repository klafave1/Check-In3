### Check-In3

#### 1. what youâ€™d hoped to accomplish for this week (i.e., a recap of your goals from the  previous week and your initial proposal) 
###### My main goal for this week was to enhance the functionality of the app by integrating reminders and notifications for medication events displayed on the calendar. I also aimed to ensure that the app displays the current date's medication schedule upon opening, with the flexibility to switch to the calendar view.

#### 2. what you did accomplish for this week, including an assessment of what went faster or  slower than you thought it would 
###### Implementing notifications was surprisingly straightforward, thanks to the online resources available. However, I encountered some challenges while working on the display of the medication list upon app launch. It took more time than anticipated to troubleshoot and resolve issues but it was relatively straightforward for the most part.

#### 3. what you hope to accomplish for next week
###### My primary focus next week will be on testing the calendar functionality to ensure accuracy and usability, and also on the display.
